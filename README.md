# LEGO Datasets EDA with Pandas

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project explores various aspects of LEGO sets and parts using the LEGO datasets. The goal was to uncover interesting insights about the complexity, popularity, stock status, and other characteristics of LEGO sets and their components.

## Insights

- **Null and Duplicate Analysis**: Identified missing data and duplicate records to ensure data quality.
- **Top Most Complex LEGO Sets**: Determined LEGO sets with the maximum number of parts, highlighting the most intricate builds.
- **Transparent vs. Opaque Part Colors**: Calculated the percentage of transparent LEGO part colors compared to opaque ones.
- **Part Categories with Most Units Produced**: Analyzed which categories of LEGO parts have the highest production volumes.
- **Most Popular Themes Among LEGO Sets**: Explored which LEGO themes are most frequent and favored by consumers.
- **Theme Popularity Over the Years**: Tracked the trends in theme popularity across different years.
- **LEGO Sets Stock Status**: Identified LEGO sets that are in stock, out of stock, or have limited stock availability.
- **Spare Parts Availability**: Investigated which parts come with spares and which do not.
- **Most Popular LEGO Colors**: Ranked LEGO colors by their frequency in the dataset.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting insights.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `lego_dataset_EDA.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
